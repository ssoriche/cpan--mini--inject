Revision history for CPAN-Mini-Inject

0.12    01/04/2005
        - Tests failed for inject and add on Windows systems. These tests
          have now been skipped.
        - Reverted all tests to use eval{}. Using eval "" caused problems
          on Windows, while eval{} only caused problems on one AIX box.

0.10    12/30/2004
        - Fixed dirmode in inject(), add(), writelist(), so that all files
          created are set with the correct permissions.
        - Added tests for directory and file modes.

0.08    12/08/2004
        - Tests were found to fail on AIX which contained eval{}, all
          tests updated with eval "".
        - Added a default value for dirmode in update_mirror based on
          umask.
        - Added a dirmode option to the config file.
        - Fixed regex in mcpani to allow for developer version numbers
          with add (ie. CPAN-Mini-Inject-0.07_001).
        - Add a prereq for CPAN::Mini version 0.24. This version contains
          a bugfix to properly handle dirmode. (Thanks RJBS).

0.06    11/10/2004

        - mcpani now parses the file passed to it to determine module name
          and version. Command line options override the parsing.
        - loadcfg() croaks if no configuration file is found.

0.04    11/05/2004

        - t/readlist.t and t/writelist.t both skip failure tests if
          the uid is 0.
        - inject accepts a true parameter to enable verbose mode which
          lists modules as they are injected.
        - testremote accepts a true parameter to enable verbose mode 
          which display the site being tested, and which is selected.
        - Added --passive switch to mcpani to enable passive ftp
        - Minor updates to perldoc in mcpani
        - Added CPAN::Mini as a required module to Makefile.PL

0.02    10/31/2004
