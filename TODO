- to update_mirror add the option for specifying a umask or use the
  current system umask as the default. This overides the way
  CPAN::Mini works.

- to mcpani add a command line option to set passive ftp.

- Add logging to a file all the updates that are occuring (verbose mode
  to a file).

- Add a method to remove packages from the repository

- Add verbose messags to testremote, that show when an alternate site
  has been selected.

- To non-readable, non-writable tests check to see if the UID is 0, as
  testing for read/write failures with root doesn't work.
